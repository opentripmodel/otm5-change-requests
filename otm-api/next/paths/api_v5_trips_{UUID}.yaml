                  For example: your system might send ETA information for the
                  arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear

                  what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                  information about what caused this ETA update by including

                  an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                  location update, this event can be included as context. If

                  the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
                  vehicle, you can include that event in the context.
