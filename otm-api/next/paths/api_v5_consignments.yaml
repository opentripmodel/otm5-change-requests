                  arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear

                  what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some

                  an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                  location update, this event can be included as context. If

                  the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the

                  Because of various reasons a consignment can be

                  cancelled and replaced by one or more other consignments. An
                  example is that the consignment is too large

                  to be transported as a single 'transportable unit'. You can
                  use the `relation` field in the association to

                vehicle, special instructions related to consignor and
                consignee. Note that you can put the constraints on the

                individual goods. However using constraints on the consignment
                is simpler and therefore recommended when

                possible.

                Consignments that have replaced the current consignment. Because
                of various reasons a consignment can be

                cancelled and replaced by one or more other consignments. An
                example is that the consignment is too large

                to be transported as a single 'transportable unit'. You can use
                the `relation` field in the association to

                indicate the type of relationship.
