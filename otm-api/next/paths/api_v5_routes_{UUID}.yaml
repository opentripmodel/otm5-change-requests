                   on the current state of this entity.

                  For example: your system might send ETA information for the
                  arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear

                  what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                  information about what caused this ETA update by including

                  an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                  location update, this event can be included as context. If

                  the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
                  vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                  External attributes are a simple way to add information in an
                  OpenTripModel message that could not fit into one of
                    the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
                    ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

                   > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
                     it was intended.
