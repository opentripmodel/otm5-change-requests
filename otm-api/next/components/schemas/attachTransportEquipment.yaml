  contextEvents:
    description: >-
      The context events provides some optional information about the events
      that can provide additional information
       on the current state of this entity.

      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a
      vehicle on a location. To make it clear

      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about
      what caused this ETA update by including

      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update,
      this event can be included as context. If

      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you
      can include that event in the context.

  externalAttributes:
    description: >
      External attributes are a simple way to add information in an
      OpenTripModel message that could not fit into one of
        the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
        ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

       > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
         it was intended.

  lifecycle:
    description: >-
      A lifecycle models _when_ the data in the action is taking place. You can
      provide the same action in multiple

      lifecycles to model how it changes over time. For example the planned and
      realized time of an action taking place

      can differ because of unforseen circumstances (such as traffic jams).

      - requested

  result:
    description: >-
      The result of the action, can only be present in the actual or realized
      lifecycles. The result has a

      required status and optional additional info, like a remark and reason (in
      the case of failure).
    type: object
    properties:

      remark:
        description: >-
          The remark of the result, usually only interesting in case the result
          was failed or partially succeedded. Note that

          differs from the remark on an action, which is a remark that is
          relevant before the execution of the action. Whereas

          this remark is relevant for the result after execution.
        type: string
      reason:
        description: >-
          The reason why the action (partially) failed. Currently the only
          supported reasons are 'damage' and

          `receiverAbsent`. E.g. as an example of the former: the handOver
          failed because the goods were too damaged and

          were rejected. An example of the latter is when the goods were planned
          to be delivered but nobody was there

          to receive the goods and therefore had to be taken back.
