      Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does
      not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to
      use

      any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5
      consistently there are a few rules:

      * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217
      standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)

      * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI
      system (International System of
      Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
      is
        recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but
      Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again
      avoid
        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
        (C, F, or K).
      * For velocity use the metric system. The required
      format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the
      metric
        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these
      rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

      benefit from using a standard comes from consistent
      use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes
      your benefit.
