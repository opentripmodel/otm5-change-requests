      Uniquely identifies this entity. A URI can be assigned by the client to
      indicate where more information

  contextEvents:
    description: >-
      The context events provides some optional information about the events
      that can provide additional information
       on the current state of this entity.

      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a
      vehicle on a location. To make it clear

      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about
      what caused this ETA update by including

      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update,
      this event can be included as context. If

      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you
      can include that event in the context.

  externalAttributes:
    description: >
      External attributes are a simple way to add information in an
      OpenTripModel message that could not fit into one of
        the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
        ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

       > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
         it was intended.
