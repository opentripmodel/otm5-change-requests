          Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any
          units of measure. So you are free to use

          any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently
          there are a few rules:

          * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217
          standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)

          * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system
          (International System of
          Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
          is
            recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
            proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
          * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and
          Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
            problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
            (C, F, or K).
          * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then
          be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
            system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

          Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though
          only do so if strictly necessary. The

          benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating
          from the recommendations diminishes your

          benefit.
