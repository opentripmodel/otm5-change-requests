  relation:
    description: >-
      New consignments can replace previous consignments because one of two
      reasons:
       * **split**: when the consignment is split into multiple sub-consignments, for example because the contents were too large for single transport.
       * **postponed**: when the consignment could not be delivered correctly.

      Note that the relation only goes from previous consignment to new
      consignment and not vice-versa. See also the

      `relatedConsignments` field on Consignments.
