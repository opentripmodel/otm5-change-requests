      The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:


      - **Carrier**: the actor which is responsible for physically delivering
      the goods from one place to another. Note
        that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
      - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the main
      contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

      - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

      - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

      - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

      - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the goods.

      - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical delivery
      of the goods.

      - **Owner**: The actor owning the associated entity, e.g. the owner of a
      location or vehicle.


      **How these are related**

      The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_ is the
      party responsible for

      ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one responsible
      for transporting the goods, and ensures

      they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the carrier can
      delegate the actual delivery to

      another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person driving
      the vehicle. Note that a single

      actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the shipper
      and consignor at the same time. Also

      note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these roles.
      Then the roles may be left empty. However

      if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.
