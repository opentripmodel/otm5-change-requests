      Uniquely identifies this entity. A URI can be assigned by the client to
      indicate where more information
       can be retrieved. Note that every entity always has a unique EntityId. However since, OTM5.2 it is not
       required to send it in the request. One can be generated for you by the server.

  contextEvents:
    description: >-
      The context events provides some optional information about the events
      that can provide additional information
       on the current state of this entity.

      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a
      vehicle on a location. To make it clear

      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about
      what caused this ETA update by including

      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update,
      this event can be included as context. If

      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you
      can include that event in the context.
