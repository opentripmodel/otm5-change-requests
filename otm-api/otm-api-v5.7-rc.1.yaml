    # Open Trip Model

    ### Why OTM?

    In this day and age more and more information about logistics and traffic is shared over the Internet between
    various parties. To make this communication easier the _Open Trip Model_ specification was created. It is a
    lightweight data model used to exchange real-time logistic trip data on the web, and to make it easier for
    shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers to create new multi-brand applications and
    services.

    To learn more about the what, the why and the how see the **[developer portal](https://otm5developerportal.redoc.ly/)**.

  - name: Vehicle
    description: |-
      A `Vehicle` is a means to transport consignments from one location to potentially multiple other locations. There
      are various types of vehicles, each with their own unique properties like size, dimensions, fuel type and means
      of tranport (by air, on land, over sea).
  - name: Route
    description: A route models the path going from one location to at least one other location.
  - name: Sensor
    description: A sensor is a device that is able to measure a quantity in a certain unit, such as measuring the speed in km/h.
  - name: Location
    description: Object describing a geographic location. A location can either be a point or an area.
  - name: Actor
    description: |
      An `Actor` models a legal entity. A legal entity is an individual, company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations. The use of
      `Actors` is optional, and is not necessary to use OpenTripModel. Actors can be used e.g. to group all locations that belong to an organisation,
       or to address an OpenTripModel message to a specific person or organisation.
  - name: Consignment
    description: |-
      A consignment is a description of an identifiable collection of goods items to be transported between the consignor
      and the consignee. This information may be defined within a transport contract.
  - name: Trip
    description: |
      A Trip is an aggregate entity that combines various entities to model visiting various locations, potentially doing
      one or multiple actions on each location, such as loading or unloading consignments. It is optionally coupled to a
      `Vehicle` that is/was driving this trip.
  - name: Event
    description: |-
      Events - like actions - model _dynamic_ entities that couple various _static_ entities at a certain moment in
       time. Events are used for either real-time updates, or updates on earlier provided data. Notice that in both
       event types these are _updates_ on earlier provided data, whereas actions are usually used together with the
       entities they dynamically couple.

       There are various kinds of events that fall into the two earlier mentioned kinds.

       **Real-time updates**:
       - The **LocationUpdateEvent** that provides location data received from some GPS.
       - The **SensorUpdateEvent** that provides sensor value updates (such as temperature or speed measurements) received from a sensor.
       - The **StartMovingEvent**, **StopMovingEvent**, **StartEngineEvent**, **StopEngineEvent** that indicate events provided by Fleet Management Systems.

      **Both real-time and projected/realized events**
      - The **EmissionEvent** that contains information about how much emission has been produced during a move / on a trip / per consignment.
        Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.
      - The **FuelConsumedEvent** that contains information about how much fuel was consumed during a move / on a trip / per consignment.
        Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.

      **Updates on earlier provided data**:
       - The **UpdateEvent** that is used to update an earlier provided entity with new information. Note that only the changed data has to be provided.
       - The **AssociationCreatedEvent** and **AssociationRemovedEvent** that allow for _static_ entities to be coupled after the fact. Such as coupling a Vehicle to a Trip.
  - name: Action
    description: |-
      Actions are _dynamic_ entities that are able to couple together various _static_ entities at a certain moment in
       time. For instance a Load action couples together a Consignment and a Vehicle at the moment the Loading happens.

       There are various types of Actions:
       - The **Stop** that models visiting a certain location at a certain time and potentially doing several other actions at that location.
       - The **Load** action, that models loading in one or multiple Consignments into a vehicle or some sort of container.
       - The **Unload** action, that models unloading one or multiple Consignments from a vehicle or some other sort of container.
       - The **HandOver** that indicates transferring a consignment from one Actor to another.
       - The **Move** that models moving between two or more locations, potentially with detailed route information on _how_ to move between these locations.
       - The **AttachTransportEquipment** that allows you to attach some equipment to the associated vehicle. Note that you can both
         load/unload and attach/detach TransportEquipments. For instance loading a container on a ship, or attach a trailer to a truck. So choose the one that is most appropriate.
       - The **DetachTransportEquipment** that allows you to detach some previously attached equipment from the associated vehicle.
       - The **Break** action that models a mandatory resting period for the driver of the vehicle. During this period
         the driver is prohibited from doing any driving activities or other work.
       - The **Wait** action that models waiting at a particular location during the trip. This can be due to various
         circumstances such as waiting for the vehicle to be transported by a ferry or train. Or because of waiting at
         frontiers or docks (e.g. the dock of the loading/unload location is occupied) or traffic prohibitions. The
         driver is allowed to leave the vehicle during this period. An important aspect distinguishing this from the
         _break_ action is that waiting times can be shortened because of changing circumstances. For example, if the
         original waiting time was expected to be 15 minutes because of an occupied dock, but the driver is 10 minutes
         late, the waiting time can be shortened to 5 minutes until the dock is free.
       - The **GenericAction** for whenever any of the above actions cannot model the situation appropriately.
  - name: Goods
    description: |-
      Goods are the items to be transported as part of a consignment. Goods can be divided into two sub-types
       of goods, depending on the use case and the level of detail. Goods either consists of items, describing the
       actual goods to be transported. Or a transport equipment, which is equipment used to carry the actual goods to
       be transported. Transport equipment is (usually) a means to an end, not something that needs to be transported
       on itself, such as pallets.

       Note that goods can either be or contain dangerous goods. OTM uses the official specification of
       [ADR](https://unece.org/transportdangerous-goods/adr-2021-files) to describe in what manner and how dangerous
       those goods are. The used descriptions in the OTM documentation are extracted from document
       [ADR2021_Vol1e_0.pdf](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/ADR2021_Vol1e_0.pdf). The official
       documentation is always leading and should be consulted.
  - name: TransportOrder
    description: |-
      The TransportOrder is the top-level entity to model a group of related consignments that might be transported
      separately, but need to be administered together. For consistency, even if there is only one consignment,
      it is still required to use a transport order.
  - name: Document
    description: |
      In many logistic operations documents are an important part of the data flow. Documents can serve multiple
      purposes, such as proving some package was delivered with help of a photo, or some scanned document that
      establishes that the transferred goods are accepted on handover. Documents in OTM come in two flavors, either
      you provide the content of the document directly as a base64 encoded string, or you provide a link to the
      document where it can be accessed online.
  - name: Constraint
    description: |2
       `Constraints` can do different things, depending on the context they're used in:
        - In the context of a `Location`, access to the location is only allowed if the given constraint applies.
        - In the context of a `Trip`, constraints can be used to define constraints that have to be met during the trip, e.g. if the temperature in
          a refrigerated trailer has to stay below a given maximum during the trip.
        - In the context of a `Shipment`, constraints can be used to e.g. define minimum or maximum temperatures for shipments, or date time
          constraints for delivery.

      Since OTM5.2 the _timeWindowConstraint_ is supported which allows you to give (optionally) both the start and end
      time of the window between which something needs to occur. This replaces the old style where you had to use an _and_
      constraint in combination with the _startDateTimeConstraint_ and _endDateTimeConstraint_. Since the new solution
      is shorter and simpler the _startDateTimeConstraint_ and _endDateTimeConstraint_ are **deprecated**.

      Note that constraints can be nested and combined using the `andConstraint`, `orConstraint` and `notConstraint`.

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear
                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      External attributes are a simple way to add information in an OpenTripModel message that could not fit into one of
                        the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
                        ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

                       > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
                         it was intended.

                    the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                    Sometimes more than one sensor can be associated with a single entity. This is the case e.g. in cooled trailers that are divided into
                    compartments with different temperatures, where each compartment has its own sensor. The `placement` member can be used to identify where
                    a sensor is placed. Parties using OpenTripModel to exchange sensor data may wish to agree on a standardized naming, but this is too
                    specific to describe in the standard.

                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      External attributes are a simple way to add information in an OpenTripModel message that could not fit into one of
                        the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
                        ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

                       > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
                         it was intended.

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear
                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear
                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                          Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                          any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                          * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                          * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is

                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                          Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                          any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                          * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                          * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                            recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                            proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                          * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                            problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                            (C, F, or K).
                          * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                            system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                          Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                          benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                          benefit.

                          any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                          * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                          * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                            recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                            proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                          * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                            problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                            (C, F, or K).
                          * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                            system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                          Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                          benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:

            - **Carrier**: the actor which is responsible for physically delivering the goods from one place to another. Note
              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.
            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.
            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.
            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.
            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the goods.
            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical delivery of the goods.
            - **Owner**: The actor owning the associated entity, e.g. the owner of a location or vehicle.

            **How these are related**
            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_ is the party responsible for

                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                      Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                      any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                      * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                      * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                        recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                      benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                      benefit.

              the OTM fields otherwise. The `externalAttributes` member is meant for additional meta data and/or additional
              ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

             > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
               it was intended.

            For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear
            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

            The context events provides some optional information about the events that can provide additional information
             on the current state of this entity.

            For example: your system might send ETA information for the arrival of a vehicle on a location. To make it clear
            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

              ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

             > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
               it was intended.

                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                      any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                      * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                      * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                        recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                      benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

                        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

            New consignments can replace previous consignments because one of two reasons:
             * **split**: when the consignment is split into multiple sub-consignments, for example because the contents were too large for single transport.
             * **postponed**: when the consignment could not be delivered correctly.

            Note that the relation only goes from previous consignment to new consignment and not vice-versa. See also the

            **How these are related**
            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_ is the party responsible for
            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures
            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the carrier can delegate the actual delivery to
            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person driving the vehicle. Note that a single
            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the shipper and consignor at the same time. Also
            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However
            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

             * **split**: when the consignment is split into multiple sub-consignments, for example because the contents were too large for single transport.
             * **postponed**: when the consignment could not be delivered correctly.

            Note that the relation only goes from previous consignment to new consignment and not vice-versa. See also the
            `relatedConsignments` field on Consignments.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

          * incomplete
            Indicates that the delivery or transport operation was not fully completed. This could be due to partial delivery, missing items, or an inability to deliver all goods as planned.
          * invalidAddress
            The specified address is incorrect or does not exist.
          * invalidShippingLabel
            The shipping label contains incorrect or unreadable information.
          * receiverAbsent

                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

            Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
            any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
            * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
            * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
              recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
              proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
            * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
              problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
              (C, F, or K).
            * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
              system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

            Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
            benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your benefit.
            If the type of unit you need is not supported please create a [change request](https://github.com/opentripmodel/otm5-change-requests)

              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.
            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.
            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.
            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.
            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the goods.
            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical delivery of the goods.
            - **Owner**: The actor owning the associated entity, e.g. the owner of a location or vehicle.

            **How these are related**
            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_ is the party responsible for
            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures
            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:

            - **Carrier**: the actor which is responsible for physically delivering the goods from one place to another. Note
              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.
            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.
            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.
            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.
            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the goods.
            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical delivery of the goods.
            - **Owner**: The actor owning the associated entity, e.g. the owner of a location or vehicle.

            **How these are related**
            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_ is the party responsible for
            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures
            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the carrier can delegate the actual delivery to
            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person driving the vehicle. Note that a single
            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the shipper and consignor at the same time. Also
            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However
            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be \<length\>/\<time unit\> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

              ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

             > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
               it was intended.

               it was intended.

            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information about what caused this ETA update by including
            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location update, this event can be included as context. If
            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

              ID's of an entity. This can also help to identify an OTM entity in a system by the ID of that system.

             > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
               it was intended.
