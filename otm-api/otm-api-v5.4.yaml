    # Open Trip Model


    ### Why OTM?


    In this day and age more and more information about logistics and traffic is
    shared over the Internet between

    various parties. To make this communication easier the _Open Trip Model_
    specification was created. It is a

    lightweight data model used to exchange real-time logistic trip data on the
    web, and to make it easier for

    shippers, carriers, software vendors, OEMs, and truck manufacturers to
    create new multi-brand applications and

    services.


    To learn more about the what, the why and the how see the **[developer
    portal](https://otm5developerportal.redoc.ly/)**.

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for

                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                      information about what caused this ETA update by including

                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                      location update, this event can be included as context. If

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of
                      the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      information about what caused this ETA update by including

                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                      location update, this event can be included as context. If

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of
                      the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of

                    For example: your system might send ETA information for the

                    what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some

                    an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                    location update, this event can be included as context. If

                    the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
                    vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                    cancelled and replaced by one or more other consignments. An
                    example is that the consignment is too large

                      cancelled and replaced by one or more other consignments.

                    an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for

                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                      information about what caused this ETA update by including

                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                      location update, this event can be included as context. If

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of
                      the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                    For example: your system might send ETA information for the

                    what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                    information about what caused this ETA update by including

                    an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                    location update, this event can be included as context. If

                    the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
                    vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                          Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                          any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                          * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                          * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                            recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                            proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                          * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                            problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                            (C, F, or K).

                            any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                            * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                            * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                              recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                              proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                            * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                              problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                              (C, F, or K).
                            * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                              system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                            Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

                    For example: your system might send ETA information for the

                    what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                    information about what caused this ETA update by including

                    an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                    location update, this event can be included as context. If

                    the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
                    vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                        any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                        * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                        * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                          recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                          proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                        * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                          problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                          (C, F, or K).
                        * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                          system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                        Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                        benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

                        any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                        * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                        * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                          recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                          proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                        * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                          problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                          (C, F, or K).
                        * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                          system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                        Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                        benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

                            Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                            any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                            * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                            * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                              recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                              proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                            * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                              problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                              (C, F, or K).
                            * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                              system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                            Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                            benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                            benefit.

                      For example: your system might send ETA information for

                      what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some
                      information about what caused this ETA update by including

                      an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a
                      location update, this event can be included as context. If

                      the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of
                      the vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

  - name: Actor
    description: >
      An `Actor` models a legal entity. A legal entity is an individual,
      company, or organization that has legal rights and obligations. The use of

      `Actors` is optional, and is not necessary to use OpenTripModel. Actors
      can be used e.g. to group all locations that belong to an organisation,
       or to address an OpenTripModel message to a specific person or organisation.
  - name: Consignment
    description: >-
      A consignment is a description of an identifiable collection of goods

      and the consignee. This information may be defined within a transport
      contract.
  - name: Trip
    description: >
      A Trip is an aggregate entity that combines various entities to model
      visiting various locations, potentially doing

      one or multiple actions on each location, such as loading or unloading
      consignments. It is optionally coupled to a

      `Vehicle` that is/was driving this trip.
  - name: Event
    description: "Events - like actions - model _dynamic_ entities that couple
      various _static_ entities at a certain moment in

      \ time. Events are used for either real-time updates, or updates on
      earlier provided data. Notice that in both

      \ event types these are _updates_ on earlier provided data, whereas
      actions are usually used together with the

      \ entities they dynamically couple.


      \ There are various kinds of events that fall into the two earlier
      mentioned kinds.


      \ **Real-time updates**:

      \ - The **LocationUpdateEvent** that provides location data received from
      some GPS.

      \ - The **SensorUpdateEvent** that provides sensor value updates (such as
      temperature or speed measurements) received from a sensor.

      \ - The **StartMovingEvent**, **StopMovingEvent**, **StartEngineEvent**,
      **StopEngineEvent** that indicate events provided by Fleet Management
      Systems.


      **Both real-time and projected/realized events**

      - The **EmissionEvent** that contains information about how much emission
      has been produced during a move / on a trip / per consignment.

      \  Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some
      calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.

      - The **FuelConsumedEvent** that contains information about how much fuel
      was consumed during a move / on a trip / per consignment.

      \  Can be provided as an actual value, projected based on some
      calculation, or realized as measured by some sensor.


      **Updates on earlier provided data**:

      \ - The **UpdateEvent** that is used to update an earlier provided entity
      with new information. Note that only the changed data has to be provided.

      \ - The **AssociationCreatedEvent** and **AssociationRemovedEvent** that
      allow for _static_ entities to be coupled after the fact. Such as coupling
      a Vehicle to a Trip.

      \ "
  - name: Action
    description: >-
      Actions are _dynamic_ entities that are able to couple together various
      _static_ entities at a certain moment in
       time. For instance a Load action couples together a Consignment and a Vehicle at the moment the Loading happens.

       There are various types of Actions:
       - The **Stop** that models visiting a certain location at a certain time and potentially doing several other actions at that location.
       - The **Load** action, that models loading in one or multiple Consignments into a vehicle or some sort of container.
       - The **Unload** action, that models unloading one or multiple Consignments from a vehicle or some other sort of container.
       - The **HandOver** that indicates transferring a consignment from one Actor to another.
       - The **Move** that models moving between two or more locations, potentially with detailed route information on _how_ to move between these locations.
       - The **AttachTransportEquipment** that allows you to attach some equipment to the associated vehicle. Note that you can both
         load/unload and attach/detach TransportEquipments. For instance loading a container on a ship, or attach a trailer to a truck. So choose the one that is most appropriate.
       - The **DetachTransportEquipment** that allows you to detach some previously attached equipment from the associated vehicle.
       - The **Break** action that models a mandatory resting period for the driver of the vehicle. During this period
         the driver is prohibited from doing any driving activities or other work.
       - The **Wait** action that models waiting at a particular location during the trip. This can be due to various
         circumstances such as waiting for the vehicle to be transported by a ferry or train. Or because of waiting at
         frontiers or docks (e.g. the dock of the loading/unload location is occupied) or traffic prohibitions. The
         driver is allowed to leave the vehicle during this period. An important aspect distinguishing this from the
         _break_ action is that waiting times can be shortened because of changing circumstances. For example, if the
         original waiting time was expected to be 15 minutes because of an occupied dock, but the driver is 10 minutes
         late, the waiting time can be shortened to 5 minutes until the dock is free.
       - The **GenericAction** for whenever any of the above actions cannot model the situation appropriately.
  - name: Goods
    description: >-
      Goods are the items to be transported as part of a consignment. Goods can
      be divided into two sub-types
       of goods, depending on the use case and the level of detail. Goods either consists of items, describing the
       actual goods to be transported. Or a transport equipment, which is equipment used to carry the actual goods to
       be transported. Transport equipment is (usually) a means to an end, not something that needs to be transported
       on itself, such as pallets.

       Note that goods can either be or contain dangerous goods. OTM uses the official specification of
       [ADR](https://unece.org/transportdangerous-goods/adr-2021-files) to describe in what manner and how dangerous
       those goods are. The used descriptions in the OTM documentation are extracted from document
       [ADR2021_Vol1e_0.pdf](https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/ADR2021_Vol1e_0.pdf). The official
       documentation is always leading and should be consulted.
  - name: TransportOrder
    description: >-
      The TransportOrder is the top-level entity to model a group of related
      consignments that might be transported

      separately, but need to be administered together. For consistency, even if
      there is only one consignment,

      it is still required to use a transport order.
  - name: Document
    description: >
      In many logistic operations documents are an important part of the data
      flow. Documents can serve multiple

      purposes, such as proving some package was delivered with help of a photo,
      or some scanned document that

      establishes that the transferred goods are accepted on handover. Documents
      in OTM come in two flavors, either

      you provide the content of the document directly as a base64 encoded
      string, or you provide a link to the

      document where it can be accessed online.
  - name: Constraint
    description: >2
       `Constraints` can do different things, depending on the context they're
      used in:
        - In the context of a `Location`, access to the location is only allowed if the given constraint applies.
        - In the context of a `Trip`, constraints can be used to define constraints that have to be met during the trip, e.g. if the temperature in
          a refrigerated trailer has to stay below a given maximum during the trip.
        - In the context of a `Shipment`, constraints can be used to e.g. define minimum or maximum temperatures for shipments, or date time
          constraints for delivery.

      Since OTM5.2 the _timeWindowConstraint_ is supported which allows you to
      give (optionally) both the start and end

      time of the window between which something needs to occur. This replaces
      the old style where you had to use an _and_

      constraint in combination with the _startDateTimeConstraint_ and
      _endDateTimeConstraint_. Since the new solution

      is shorter and simpler the _startDateTimeConstraint_ and
      _endDateTimeConstraint_ are **deprecated**.


      Note that constraints can be nested and combined using the
      `andConstraint`, `orConstraint` and `notConstraint`.

            update, this event can be included as context. If

            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the
            vehicle, you can include that event in the context.

                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                If the type of unit you need is not supported please create a

            - You might want to express the load capacities in different
            quantities. E.g. in square meters or litres as well as in number of
            pallets.

                  any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                  * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                  * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                    recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                    proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                  * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                    problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                    (C, F, or K).
                  * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                    system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                  Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                  benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                  benefit.

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:

              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:

              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                      any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                      * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                      * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                        recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                      benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                      benefit.

              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the

                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains

                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The

                      any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                      * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                      * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                        recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                        proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                      * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                        problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                        (C, F, or K).
                      * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                        system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                      Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                      benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                      benefit.

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:


            - **Carrier**: the actor which is responsible for physically
            delivering the goods from one place to another. Note
              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                If the type of unit you need is not supported please create a
                [change request](https://github.com/opentripmodel/otm5-change-requests)

            what caused this ETA to be updated, we can include some information

            an event as context. If your ETA update was caused by a location
            update, this event can be included as context. If

            the ETA was caused by a traffic accident on the route of the

             > Please, use this with caution: having too many external attributes can be a sign of not using OpenTripModel as
               it was intended.

                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:


            - **Carrier**: the actor which is responsible for physically
            delivering the goods from one place to another. Note
              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

              description: |-
                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.

            The roles this actor can have, one or multiple of:

            delivering the goods from one place to another. Note
              that the actual transport can be delegated to another party (subcontractor), but the carrier remains responsible.
            - **Shipper**: the actor that engages in shipping goods and is the
            main contractor, ensuring the shipment takes place.

            - **Consignee**: the actor that is the buyer of the goods.

            - **Consignor**: the actor that sells the goods.

            - **Receiver**: the actor that receives the goods.

            - **Driver**: the actor that drives the vehicle containing the
            goods.

            - **Subcontractor**: The actor actually carrying out the physical
            delivery of the goods.


            **How these are related**

            The _consignee_ requires goods from the _consignor_. The _shipper_
            is the party responsible for

            ensuring this shipment takes place. The _carrier_ is the one
            responsible for transporting the goods, and ensures

            they are delivered to the _receiver_. If required/desired, the
            carrier can delegate the actual delivery to

            another party, the _subcontractor_. A _driver_ is an actual person
            driving the vehicle. Note that a single

            actor can have multiple roles, for instance, an actor can be the
            shipper and consignor at the same time. Also

            note that there might be an actor that does not fit any of these
            roles. Then the roles may be left empty. However

            if the role of the actor fits any of the above it must be present.

                Measurement unit of this value. OTM5 currently does not enforce any units of measure. So you are free to use
                any unit necessary. However to ensure parties use OTM5 consistently there are a few rules:
                * For **currencies** use the [ISO_4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217)
                * For **mass**, **volume** and **length** the [SI system (International System of Units)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) is
                  recommended. To avoid problems with symbols, square and cubic units of measure are simply communicated using the
                  proper number. Thus a square meter is `m2` and a cubic meter is `m3`.
                * For degrees the recommend approach is Celsius, but Fahrenheit and Kelvin are also supported. To again avoid
                  problems with symbols, the degree symbol (° in °C) is left off, thus only the single capital letter remains
                  (C, F, or K).
                * For velocity use the metric system. The required format would then be <length>/<time unit> for the metric
                  system, such as km/h (kilometer per hour) or m/s (meter per second).

                Since usage is not enforced you can deviate from these rules, though only do so if strictly necessary. The
                benefit from using a standard comes from consistent use, so deviating from the recommendations diminishes your
                benefit.
