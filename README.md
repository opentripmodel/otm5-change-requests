# Welcome to the OTM5 change request tracker

If you have ideas for the [OTM5 specification][otm5-spec] or found a bug, please report them here.

[otm5-spec]: https://otm5.opentripmodel.org/

## Where do I go for questions? 🤔

Please go to the [Open Trip Model discussion forum][otm-discuss] first. We would like to keep this tracker focused on
change requests and bugs.

[otm-discuss]: https://www.opentripmodel.org/discuss

## How do I submit a change request? 📈

A change request can be any improvement or addition to the existing specification.

Before opening a change request, please search in the [issues][issues] to make sure that a similar change has not been
previously requested. If so it could be planned for a future version of OTM and you can contribute to the discussion in
the existing issue. If your request is new, open an issue by pressing `New issue` in the upper right corner. Please use
the "Feature request" template to help provide the best possible information.

## How do I submit a bug? 🐛

A bug can be any fault, inconsistency or contradiction in the specification itself or the way the spec is represented
[on the website][otm5-spec]. It can also be something that is unclear in the spec, but you might want to consider asking
a question in the [discussion forum][otm-discuss] first.

The process is similar to change requests: before opening a bug, please search in the [issues][issues] to make sure that
the bug has not been reported already. If the bug is new, open an issue by pressing the `New issue` in the upper right
corner.  Please use the "Bug report" template to help provide the best possible information.

## When will the new feature or bugfix be available? 🚀

OTM5.0 has just been released, so we are still in the process of figuring this out. However we expect that;
* bugs in the rending will be fixed fast. Or at least workarounds are provided,
* unclear documentation can also be fixed fast,
* small changes to the specification will be released within 2 to 3 months,
* larger changes might be part of a beta, so we have time to try it out and improve upon it if necessary.
